# MATLAB Implicit Type Conversion Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a MATLAB function that arises from implicit type conversion between double-precision floating-point numbers and integers.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` function compares a double-precision input with the integer 1. Due to limitations in floating-point precision, values that are extremely close to 1 might not be treated as equal.  This can result in unexpected behavior. 

## Solution
The solution employs a tolerance-based comparison to account for the inherent imprecision of floating-point numbers.  The `abs` function calculates the absolute difference between the input and the target integer value. Then, this difference is checked against a defined tolerance to establish equality. 

## How to Run
1. Save the provided code as `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m`. 
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing these files. 
3. Run `bug.m` to observe the unexpected behavior.
4. Run `bugSolution.m` to see how the improved function addresses this issue.
